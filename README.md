# ModernJS
ES6/Babel  javascript course work related to ModernJS course taught by Andrew Mead.


This course builds a foundation with the basics of modern jsavascript, including primatives, operators and built-in objects.

The  next layer is arrays, objects and functions.  With these tools we build a todo app and a notes app with filters,sorting and local data storage.  Live-server is used to open and use the applications and third-party libraries are utilized to improve functionality
